With aging of population , more than one in four people is over 65 years old in Japan. <br>
For senior citizens, decreased physical strength causes issues in their daily life.<br>
I thought it would be nice if I had a device which allows us gently watching over them.<br>

A Fitbit - wearable item is an option. 
<br>It gives you a variety of data with frequent updates. Monitoring people's activity to support their healthy life.
