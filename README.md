# Monita2 🚶👩‍🦽🧓
 
With aging of population , more than one in four people is over 65 years old in Japan. With changing family system, many people live alone. For senior citizens, decreased physical strength causes issues in their daily life. As a daughter of a mother who lives in remote area, it would be nice if I had a device which allows me gently watching over my lovely mother. A Fitbit - wearable item is an option. It gives you a variety of data with frequent updates. In this talk, I will show an application monitoring people's activity to support their life.
